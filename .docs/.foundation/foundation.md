# **🚀 ETH Cash Back**

**Cashback & Gas Sponsorship Infrastructure for Web3**

---

## **🔍 Problem**

Gas fees are one of the biggest frictions in Web3 adoption.

* Users hesitate to interact because every transaction costs ETH.

* dApps struggle with user retention and onboarding incentives.

* Implementing cashback or gas sponsorship logic is complex, expensive, and fragmented.

In Web2, cashback is a proven growth primitive.  
 In Web3, there is no reusable infrastructure for it.

---

## **💡 Solution**

**ETH Cash Back** is a **plug-and-play infrastructure layer** that allows dApps to:

* Sponsor gas fees for users

* Automatically return **2–5% ETH cashback** per transaction

* Apply **usage limits** per user (monthly / quarterly / yearly)

* Configure cashback rules **without building custom logic**

Instead of charging users for gas and fees, dApps can turn transactions into **positive-reward experiences**.

## **🧱 What ETH Cash Back Is (and Is Not)**

### **✅ It *is*:**

* Infrastructure

* A reusable economic primitive

* A retention & growth layer for dApps

### **❌ It is *not*:**

* A wallet

* A DEX

* A standalone consumer app

ETH Cash Back is designed to be **embedded** inside any dApp.

---

## **⚙️ How It Works (High Level)**

1. A dApp registers a cashback configuration:

   * Cashback percentage (e.g. 2%)

   * Cashback limit per user

   * Validity window

2. A user performs a transaction through ETH Cash Back.

3. The system:

   * Sponsors or simulates gas fees

   * Calculates eligible cashback

   * Transfers ETH cashback directly to the user

   * Enforces usage limits automatically

4. The user receives:

   * Successful transaction

   * ETH cashback

   * A friction-free experience

## **🧪 Demo Use Case (Hackathon MVP)**

**DEX onboarding cashback**

* New users receive **2% ETH cashback**

* Cashback applies to the **first 5 trades**

* Gas fees are sponsored (simulated in MVP)

This demonstrates how dApps can:

* Reduce onboarding friction

* Incentivize early usage

* Retain users without issuing new tokens

---

## **🧩 Technical Overview (MVP Scope)**

### **Smart Contracts**

* Cashback rule storage

* Per-user usage tracking

* ETH cashback distribution

* Hard limits enforcement

### **Frontend**

* Simple transaction interface

* Real-time display of:

  * Transaction amount

  * Cashback received

  * Gas sponsorship status

The MVP intentionally focuses on **core logic clarity** rather than production-grade optimization.

---

## **🧠 Why This Is Innovative**

* Introduces **cashback as a native Web3 primitive**

* Turns gas fees from a cost into a reward

* Creates a **standardized incentive layer** usable by any dApp

* Removes the need for custom incentive contracts per project

This shifts how users emotionally experience blockchain transactions.

---

## **🔮 Future Potential**

* ERC-4337 Paymaster integration for true gas abstraction

* SDKs for easy dApp integration

* Multi-chain support

* Advanced fraud & abuse prevention

* Analytics for dApp incentive optimization

ETH Cash Back can evolve into the **Stripe-style cashback layer for Web3**.

---

## **🏁 Conclusion**

ETH Cash Back reimagines how users pay for blockchain transactions.

By combining gas sponsorship and ETH cashback into a reusable infrastructure layer, it unlocks a new growth and retention primitive for the Web3 ecosystem.
